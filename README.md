#MEng_Project
This is the web front for my MEng group project. The overall project is about drawing and displaying Venn/Euler Diagrams and including an EA to learn what is and is not considered a good diagram. 

#What I Used
For this part of the project it is just the React Front end. Chose React due to the ability to update the shapes and the update propogating across the whole data set.
